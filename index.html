        <h2>Gone Too Soon: Remembering Harambe, the Beloved Gorilla</h2>
        <img src="./images/Harmabe.webp" alt="A panda eating bamboo.">
        <p>
            Harambe, the gorilla who stole hearts and made headlines, will always be remembered as the primate who
            liveda short but eventful life. From chilling in the moat to becoming a meme-sensation, Harambe proved that
            gorillas can have just as much swag as any hipster on the block. Despite his untimely demise, he left a
            lasting impression on the world. So let's raise a banana in his honor, and remember the gorilla who was just
            trying to live his best life until it was tragically cut short. Rest in peace, Harambe, you will be missed
            but never
            forgotten.
